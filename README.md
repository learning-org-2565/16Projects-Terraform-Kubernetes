# 30-Day Terraform & Kubernetes Mastery Journey

## What Is This?
This repository contains a structured 30-day learning path to master Terraform and Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform through 16 carefully designed mini-projects. Each project builds upon the previous one, gradually advancing your skills from beginner (3/10) to solid intermediate (7/10) level.

## Why This Approach Works
- **Small, manageable projects** (completable in 60-90 minutes each)
- **Practical, hands-on learning** (no theory-only exercises)
- **Progressive difficulty curve** (building on previous concepts)
- **Focus on real-world applications** (not academic examples)
- **Clear learning outcomes** for each project
- **Designed to avoid overwhelm** (the #1 reason people quit learning)

## The Projects

### Terraform Projects (GCP)
1. **Basic VM Deployment** - Providers, Resources, Variables
2. **VPC Networking** - Resource Dependencies, Networking Concepts
3. **Remote State Management** - GCS Backend, State Locking
4. **Modular Infrastructure** - Module Creation, Reusability
5. **Resource Management with Loops** - Count, For_Each, Dynamic Blocks
6. **Workspace Management** - Environment Isolation, Configuration
7. **Secrets and Configuration** - KMS, Secret Manager, Configuration
8. **Multi-Tier Application** - Integration of all concepts

### Kubernetes Projects
1. **Pod Basics** - Pod Lifecycle, Container Health
2. **Deployments and Services** - Application Deployment, Networking
3. **ConfigMaps and Secrets** - Configuration Management
4. **Persistent Storage** - PVs, PVCs, Volume Management
5. **StatefulSets** - Stateful Applications, Database Deployment
6. **Advanced StatefulSets** - Complex Storage Patterns
7. **Helm Charts** - Application Packaging, Templating
8. **Multi-Component Application** - Complete Application Deployment

## Time Commitment

- **Per Project**: 60-90 minutes of hands-on work + 30 minutes studying
- **Daily Pace**: One project per day (approximately 2 hours)
- **Total Duration**: 16 working days (3-4 weeks with breaks)
- **Recommended Schedule**: 4-5 projects per week

> **Note**: It's better to spend 2 hours focused daily than occasional marathon sessions. Consistency beats intensity.

## Expected Outcomes After Completion

After completing all 16 projects, you'll be able to:

- **Design and implement** production-ready infrastructure on GCP
- **Deploy and manage** containerized applications in Kubernetes
- **Automate** infrastructure provisioning and application deployment
- **Troubleshoot** common issues in both platforms
- **Understand** the why behind best practices, not just how
- **Extend** existing infrastructure with confidence
- **Read and comprehend** others' Terraform and Kubernetes code

## Rating This Learning Path (8/10)

This learning path earns an **8/10** rating because:

**Strengths:**
- Covers all essential concepts for both technologies
- Project-based approach builds practical skills
- Real-world focus prepares for actual job scenarios
- Progressive building of complexity reduces overwhelm
- Balance between breadth and depth of topics

**Limitations:**
- GCP-specific (though concepts transfer to other clouds)
- Not covering advanced topics like custom operators or providers
- Limited coverage of CI/CD integration
- No team collaboration scenarios

## What Comes Next?

After completing these projects, continue your journey with:

### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 months):
1. **Build a personal project** showcasing multiple concepts
2. **Contribute to open-source** Terraform modules or Kubernetes projects
3. **Add CI/CD pipelines** to your infrastructure
4. **Implement GitOps workflows** with tools like Flux or ArgoCD
5. **Explore multi-environment, multi-region** deployments

### Advanced Learning (3-6 months):
1. **Security hardening** and compliance
2. **Cost optimization** techniques
3. **Performance tuning** for both infrastructure and applications
4. **Service mesh implementation** with Istio
5. **Custom development** (Operators for K8s, Providers for Terraform)

## Path to Independent DevOps Consultant

Becoming an independent DevOps consultant typically requires:

- **Strong technical foundation** (these 16 projects provide this)
- **Project portfolio** demonstrating your abilities (3-6 months to build)
- **Specialized expertise** in a particular industry or technology (6-12 months)
- **Business skills** development (proposal writing, client management)
- **Network building** within the industry

**Total time from these projects to consultant readiness**: 12-18 months with focused effort

## Tips for Greatest Success

1. **Document everything** you learn (create your own knowledge base)
2. **Explain concepts to others** (reinforces understanding)
3. **Break things on purpose** then fix them (builds troubleshooting skills)
4. **Extend projects** with your own requirements
5. **Join communities** (Kubernetes/Terraform Slack, Discord, etc.)
6. **Read post-mortems** from companies to understand real-world failures
7. **Review others' code** in open source projects
8. **Set up a personal lab environment** for experimentation

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository
2. Set up your GCP account and install required tools
3. Complete one project per day, following the step-by-step guides
4. Document your learnings and challenges
5. Review and consolidate knowledge on weekends

Remember: The goal isn't to race through projects, but to understand deeply. Take time to experiment and extend the projects as you go.

Good luck on your infrastructure as code journey!
