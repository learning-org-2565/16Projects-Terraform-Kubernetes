# Terraform Project 7: Secrets and Configuration Management

## Concept Focus: KMS, Secret Manager, and Configuration Handling

### What is this project about?
This project focuses on securely managing sensitive information and configuration data in your Terraform deployments. You'll learn how to use Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption, Secret Manager for storing secrets, and various Terraform techniques for handling configuration values. This is critical for maintaining security while keeping infrastructure deployable through automation.

### Why are these concepts important?
Secure configuration management is essential because:
- **Security**: Sensitive data must never be stored in plain text in version control
- **Compliance**: Many regulations require specific handling of secrets and encryption keys
- **Auditability**: Access to sensitive configuration should be logged and monitored
- **Automation**: Infrastructure deployment should not require manual input of secrets
- **Rotation**: Secrets need to be updated periodically without changing code

Poor secrets management is one of the most common causes of security breaches in cloud environments.

### Real-world application
In enterprise environments, configuration and secrets follow strict patterns:
- Separation between infrastructure code and sensitive values
- Encryption of secrets both at rest and in transit
- Just-in-time access to secrets during deployment
- Automatic rotation of credentials at defined intervals
- Audit logging of all secret access
- Different secrets per environment with consistent handling

These practices ensure that even if code repositories are compromised, sensitive data remains protected.

### Project Components

#### 1. Google Cloud KMS
Cloud KMS allows you to create, use, and manage cryptographic keys for encrypting and decrypting data. It provides a centralized key management system with strong security controls.

```
Key KMS concepts:
- Key rings and keys
- Key rotation policy
- IAM permissions for keys
- Encryption/decryption operations
```

#### 2. Secret Manager
Google Cloud Secret Manager provides a secure and convenient way to store API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data.

```
Key Secret Manager concepts:
- Secret creation and versioning
- Secret access control
- Secret rotation
- Auditing secret access
```

#### 3. Terraform Sensitive Data
Terraform has specific mechanisms for handling sensitive data to prevent accidental exposure.

```
Key sensitive data concepts:
- Sensitive variables and outputs
- Hiding sensitive values in plans and logs
- State file security considerations
- Using environment variables for sensitive data
```

#### 4. External Configuration
Best practices include separating configuration from infrastructure code and loading it dynamically.

```
Key external configuration concepts:
- Variable files (.tfvars)
- Environment-specific configuration
- Data retrieval from external systems
- Dynamic configuration loading
```

#### 5. Provisioner Security
When using provisioners in Terraform, secrets often need to be securely passed to resources during creation or configuration.

```
Key provisioner security concepts:
- Secure script execution
- Environment variable usage
- File transfer security
- Temporary credential management
```

### Learning Goals
After completing this project, you should be able to:
- Create and manage encryption keys with Google Cloud KMS
- Store and access secrets using Secret Manager
- Properly handle sensitive data in Terraform configurations
- Implement secure configuration loading patterns
- Encrypt and decrypt data using KMS
- Understand the security implications of various configuration methods
- Set up appropriate IAM policies for secret and key access

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Storing secrets in version control**: Even if marked as sensitive in Terraform, secrets should never be in code repositories
2. **Overly permissive IAM policies**: Access to secrets and keys should follow least privilege principles
3. **Ignoring state file security**: Terraform state contains sensitive values and must be properly secured
4. **Missing secret rotation**: Static secrets are vulnerable; implement a rotation strategy
5. **Hard-coded service account keys**: Use workload identity or alternative authentication methods
6. **Not using sensitive markers**: Always mark sensitive variables and outputs to prevent logging

### Ways to Extend This Project
1. **Automated secret rotation**: Implement a process for regular rotation of secrets
2. **Custom encryption providers**: Explore alternative encryption solutions
3. **Secret access auditing**: Set up monitoring and alerting for secret access

### How This Maps to Larger Projects
In production infrastructure:
- Secrets management is a dedicated security concern with its own processes
- Different types of secrets have different handling requirements
- Secret access is tightly controlled and audited
- Encryption key management follows security best practices
- CI/CD systems have specific patterns for secure secret access
- Configuration management may span multiple tools and systems

The secure configuration practices you learn in this project form the basis for compliant, secure infrastructure deployment in any organization, regardless of size or regulatory requirements.
